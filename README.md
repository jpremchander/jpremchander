💫 About Me:
👨‍💻 About Me

🔭 I’m currently working on

Designing and implementing secure-by-design cloud architectures on AWS, with strong emphasis on identity boundaries, encryption strategy, and workload isolation

Building end-to-end DevSecOps pipelines (Jenkins → Docker → Kubernetes → AWS) with embedded security controls (SAST, dependency scanning, IaC validation)

Developing Project RADIANT — an automated Threat Intelligence & Detection engineering lab integrating MISP with Suricata

Creating modular, production-ready Terraform reference architectures supporting environment separation (dev/prod), secrets management, and least-privilege IAM

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on

Cloud security architecture design reviews

Enterprise DevSecOps transformations

Detection engineering aligned with MITRE ATT&CK

Security automation initiatives within Canadian organizations

🛠 I’m looking for help with

Large-scale Kubernetes security patterns (OPA, runtime protection, policy-as-code)

Enterprise-level cloud governance models (landing zones, guardrails, control frameworks)

Advanced threat detection engineering and telemetry optimization

📚 I’m currently learning

Cloud-native security architecture patterns used in Canadian financial & SaaS environments

Security orchestration and automation (SOAR) design at scale

AI-assisted security operations and threat analysis

Advanced container and workload protection strategies

💬 Ask me about

AWS Security Architecture & IAM design

CI/CD security integration strategies

Infrastructure as Code governance

Threat intelligence automation

Designing practical security labs that simulate real-world enterprise environments

⚡ Fun fact (about technology)
Strong cloud security architecture isn’t about adding more tools — it’s about reducing attack surface through intelligent design decisions made before deployment.
